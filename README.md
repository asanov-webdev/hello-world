# hello-world
This is a test, I'm learning how to create repositories using a "Hello World" guide
A couple of words about me? Easy. A few days ago I lived a simple life with no troubles and tough thoughts about what may the next day bring, but as I'm writing this text I'm already one small step closer to what they call "adults". As far as I remember I've never liked Mondays, nevertheless this one was not so bad I should say. Not extremely hard, but making your brain move for sure! Hope I can get into it soon, working and learning.
